# Car Data Analysis in R

This project involves analyzing automotive data from three CSV files, joined by company names. It applies data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and text mining to extract insights using R.

## Key Features:
- Dataset merge using `dplyr::inner_join()`
- Summary statistics, data structure exploration
- Predictive modeling:
  - Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
  - Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
  - ANOVA
- Text mining and topic modeling using `tm`, `topicmodels`, and `wordcloud`
- Interactive plots using `plotly` and `ggplot2`
- Data stream flow visualized using Mermaid syntax

## Tools & Packages:
- R, RStudio
- `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `tm`, `SnowballC`, `topicmodels`, `mgcv`, `caTools`

## Note:
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment during my MSc in Business Analytics at the University of Galway.
